# SibProMQTT

The SibProMQTT is an approach to protect MQTT communication from any Sybil Attack that can cause invalid message reception from unverified entities.
The SibProMQTT works by
- Checking freshness of the MQTT message
- Checking correctness of the MQTT message
- Concealing private information by means of AES encryption
